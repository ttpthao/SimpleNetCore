Because, for as long as human beings have existed, we've asked questions. Questions about the world around us. Questions about the past, about the future, about our place in the universe. As our world moves online, the search for answers has become inextricably linked with the history, and the future, of software development. The earliest mechanical calculating machines were built to answer questions - to solve complex mathematical problems many thousands of times faster than their human operators.

Today, in the age of connected devices and machine learning, we live in a world where humans ask questions and expect computers to have the answers. So let's take this chance to ask some of the really big questions: Who are we? How did we get here? How is modern software changing the way we interact with the world around us? Where are the really big questions in modern software development - and who's working on them? And how will those questions shape the future of our relationship with the machines that have become such an important part of our lives?" }

But it turns out this model doesn't always fit. It's often the case that the systems we work on are just a representation of the real world events that are happening within the business we are modelling. This isn't a problem that CRUD is very good at solving. In this talk I'll discuss the advantages of looking at your system as a distinct series of events and how doing so can help you better model your domain. I'll also talk about how this will change the way you write the software, how it changes the way your users will use the software and how it can ultimately lead to a better experience all around."},

In 201I, Bob Eel called for a Java Renaissance to capitalize on new developments on the Java platform and fight off the competition from frameworks like Ruby on Rails. The numbers show that Renaissance having an impact on server-side Java development, and many web scale companies have returned to Java for their server workloads.

Can we make a similar move in .NET and create a renaissance that will see .NET taking a role server-side in web scale deployments?

Part-history lesson, and part call to action, this talk tries to set out where we could go, if the community can create a .NET Renaissance around the .NET Core developments." },

Oftentimes, this data loses value over time, becomes irrelevant or stale, which makes handling events quickly and reliably not just desirable, but critical. However, building a system that can process hundreds of thousands, or millions, of events per second without compromising either speed or reliability is a major engineering challenge. This is where distributed data processing frameworks come in.
In this session, we’ll talk about stream data processing: where it originated, how it works, when to use it, how to build robust stream processing applications, and the tools available to us. We’ll examine the two most popular platforms used in the industry today: Apache Storm and Apache Spark, as well as some interesting up-and-coming frameworks like Flink, Kafka Streams, Apex and Microsoft Orleans Streams. Each uses a conceptually different approach, has a plethora of features, and works (or doesn’t) best for different use-cases. Understanding how and when to use which streaming data framework is key to building a reliable, scalable, robust system and avoiding painful and costly redesigns down the road." },

Get leaner, get personalized, get localized, and oh, don’t forget to account for seniors, and low-literacy users. Well, okay. Also, have you considered people with disabilities? Wait… what?
When we think about all that goes into mastering good design principles, it’s no wonder that tackling accessibility can appear like a daunting, unrealistic burden. How can we consider all of these highly technical, specific user needs when we don’t even know how people with disabilities use the web? How do we incorporate accessibility into a rapidly evolving design process that’s literally sprinting towards releases? And what about the Internet of Things? Is it time to give up?!

In this session, we'll embark on a tremulous journey through the wilderness of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and deep into the mire of assistive technologies. But, stay the course! Before you know it, you’ll feel the warm comforting rays of a heat map once again. After this experience, you’ll be equipped with five simple but powerful techniques you can integrate into your daily work.

Dominick & Brock walk you through a couple of approaches and pitfalls and use the new ASP.NET Core authorization API (which has been back-ported to standard .NET) as an example of a decent abstraction layer for clean authorization for your applications. But we will also learn that that regardless of your approach, there is no one size that fits all – that’s why it important to understand your options." },
